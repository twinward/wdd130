            <h2>Religion</h2>
            <p>Religion in Jerrua is predominantly devoted to the Maidens Rihn and Maras, however much of the population focuses their worship on another Maiden. There are also several other obscure religions, creeds, and sects of worship. Notably, over the past century, a small cult of Ascodel has slowly developed in the city. Jerrua’s three most notable religions are Maidenism, Ascodelian, and Katalism.
            <h3>Maidenism</h3>
            <p>Maidenism, also known as Septianity, is the worship of the Seven Maidens—creation deities responsible for recreating the world, and rescuing mankind from the end of the world almost 2,000 years ago. They live in Maerhiem (also known as The Maidens' Refuge), which is located just beyond Selin's Curtain. Rihn is the Maiden of the sun, patron goddess of Jerrua, and Queen of Maerhiem. Selin is the Maiden of the moon, and Rihn’s right hand in Maerhiem. Ventra is the Maiden of the sky. Dendra is the Maiden of the forest. Maras is the Maiden of the sea and the second patron goddess of Jerrua. Armis is the Maiden of the land. Therras is the Maiden of the fires of the depths. When referenced as a group, the Maidens are sometimes referred to as the Septimity.
            <p>Maidenism is the only formally recognized religion in Jerrua, however Jerrua is fairly tolerant of other religions. Rihn is the most worshiped of the Maidens, as the city’s patron goddess and Maras is second because of the city’s affiliations to the sea. Although different Maidens are often the focus of worship, they share a single religion. A cathedral devoted to one Maiden is always accompanied with secondary representation to the other six deities. Seven cathedrals to the Maidens are spread throughout Jerrua. The Great Cathedral emphasizes Rihn, and the other six cathedrals each emphasize a different Maiden. Other minor churches and shrines devoted to the Maidens are also spread throughout the city.
            <h3>Ascodelian</h3>
            <p>Ascodelian is a young religion worshipping Ascodel that sprung up shortly after he restored Jerrua. The church has usually remained relatively small, but over the past decade, its following has grown significantly. The Faith of Ascodel is a splinter group from the Seven Maidens that technically still worships them, however the focus of their worship is Ascodel. Ascodel's stance on the splinter sect has never been made known.
            <h3>Katalism (Order of the Red Sun)</h3>
            <p>Katalism, otherwise known as the Order of the Red Sun, is an extremist zealot group and militant order who believes that it is their duty to save and govern the world when "the sun swells red again." They believe the Maidens' Church has lost its way and vocally condemn them often. Their sermons are fanatic and full of fire, brimstone, and doomsday prophecy. The law-keepers watch them closely, but have never had any reason to take action against them.
