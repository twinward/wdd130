            <h3>Jerrua’s Founding</h3>
            <p>Jerrua was founded in year 1 as the first civilization since the calamity. Of the estimated 8,000 people who survived the calamity, a little over half stayed in the Jerrua region. Several small fishing and lumber settlements developed along the sea shore, in the modern district of Harborside. As the region expanded, they grew together, and plans were made for a palace on the top of a nearby hill. As the palace and adjacent defenses were constructed, commerce and residences developed nearby and became the Five Markets district. By the time the Maidens left the world, the city of Jerrua was well established, and the city walls were under construction. Over the next 1,000 years, Jerrua’s influence expanded, and grew into the vast queendom of Jeraheim.
            
            <h3>Late Era</h3>
            <img src="images/astrid-aidadettir.png" alt="Astrid Aidadettir">
            <p>In 1770, Queen Aida (the 58th queen) died, and a dispute arose concerning the succession of the Jeraheim. The elder daughter, Amilla, was the heir by birthright, but she was unpopular among many of the people. They expressed the desire that the second or third daughter (Avice and Astrid respectively) be queen instead. Factions divided between them, and disputes arose. After a year without a queen, it was agreed that the succession would be resolved by an elective vote. Avice won the election, and ruled tentatively for 2 years, until she was assassinated. Many thought that there would be another election between Amilla and Astrid, but Astrid withdrew her claim. In 1773 Amilla became queen.
            <p>In the year of Queen Amilla’s coronation, the  kingdom of Vanamir saw Jeraheim's weakness, and marched directly to the city of Jerrua and laid siege to it for five years. During this time and while Jerrua was unable to send aid, Vanamir conquered the rest of the country. In 1778 Amilla was betrayed—presumably by former followers of Avice. During the night, the armies of Vanamir were let into the city and almost overnight the Jerrua was overrun with the foreign occupiers. Queen Amilla was executed, however much of the royal family escaped, including Astrid and her daughter, Brigid, and Amilla’s daughter and heir, Arina.
            <p>Astrid quietly gathered forces for three years, then snuck into Jerrua by night with a small force, assassinated the governor appointed over the city, and let the rest of her army led by Brigid and Arina in through the gates. Battles raged in the streets of Jerrua for four days and on the dawn of the fifth day, Astrid formally crowned her niece as the Queen of Jerrua. After a year of peace, Arina and Brigid spent the next 12 years (until 1794) campaigning together, and regained many of their territories.
            <p>In 1794, Arina was stricken with an unidentifiable illness. She lived for another 29 years, but in 1799 she passed the queendom to her daughter, Amilla II, who became queen at the age of 49. Amilla II maintained peace in Jeraheim for 18 years before various power-hungry factions began contesting the legitimacy of the monarchy. Among these was a faction led by the granddaughter of Avice. For the next 34 years, the monarchy was constantly forced to subdue rebellions; and twice they were forced to drive back invading armies.
            <p>In 1852 a plague broke out and decimated the population. The plague took over 100,000 casualties in Jerrua alone. No cure was ever discovered but through severe quarantines and the exile of any infected person, the plague was subdued by 1856. Much of the rest of the world suffered from the plague for several more years.
            <p>The plague’s casualties included Queen Aysan (daughter of Amilla II), and Aysan’s daughters, which left no apparent heir. For the next six years, the most brutal war in history ravaged Jerrua. During this same time, many of Jerrua’s territories seceded, and several others were conquered by neighboring kingdoms. By 1862, over half the city’s population had evacuated to safer and more economically stable regions.
            <p>In 92 years, from 1770 to 1862, Jerrua’s population was reduced from nearly 400,000 to only 86,000. While still a big city, comparable to other metropolises of the time, the site of ancient legends was reduced to a quarter of its former glory.
            
            <h3>Modern Era</h3>

            <p>In 1862, after 92 years of upheaval, Ascodel (a powerful celestial sent by Rihn) arrived with a host of radiance to bring peace and stability to Jerrua. In two years, peace and stability returned to Jerrua, and the city began regaining influence over the surrounding region. In 1864 Ascodel dismissed all but 800 of his celestial army and established a new government. Ascodel has sat as Governor of Jerrua from that time until the present. Since 1864 the population has grown again to 120,000. **Insert a paragraph about the last 80 years of Ascodel's governorship. The current year is 1942.**
