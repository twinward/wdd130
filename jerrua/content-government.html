            <h2>Government</h2>
            <p>The government of Jerrua resembles a oligarchy/representative democracy hybrid, with a senate consisting of top-appointed officials as well as elected representatives. However, most of the city’s power remains with Ascodel, and the Governor of Jerrua.
            <p><b>Senate.</b> The senate consists of three bodies: The Hall of the Governor, the Assembly of Nobles, and the Assembly of the People. The Hall of the Governor consists of the city’s 16 Lord Judges, as well as any other official the Governor thinks should be there. This usually includes the Lord General and Lords of Agriculture, Commerce, Science, and Magiturgy. The Assembly of the Nobles consists of 24 elected representatives of the elites. The Assembly of the People consists of 24 elected representatives of the ‘common’ classes. The senate is the legislative power in Jerrua.
            <p><b>Hall of Judges.</b> The Hall of Judges is the judicial and law-enforcement branch of Jerrua’s government, responsible for the punishment of criminals, and resolution of civil disputes. The Hall of Judges directly oversees the Law Keeper Legion (casually known as the Street Legion)—the daily, street-level law enforcement division.
            <h2>Military</h2>
            <p>Jerrua has a standing military force of 8,000, with the ability to conscript another 6,000 militia troops relatively quickly. If necessary, another 6,000 could be conscripted. In addition to these forces, a battalion of 800 radiance has remained in Jerrua with Ascodel. Part of the standing military are trained cavalry and marines. 1,000 men are trained and equipped as cavalry, and about 2,000 men are trained marines divided between 16 battleships.
            <h2>Defense</h2>
            <p>A massive stone wall wraps around the city and stretches over 100 meters into the ocean on either end. These stone walls stand 12 meters (39 ft) tall, 8 meters (26 ft) wide at the base, and 6 meters (20 ft) wide at the top. The top 2 meters of wall are less secure than the bottom 10, with a hollow interior that doubles as aqueducts. The wall also hosts several towers, spaced out every several hundred meters. The towers stand 18 meters (60 ft) tall, constructed of the same hard stone as the wall. The middle of the wall is made of cemented gravel, with only the inner and outer 2 meters being made of cut stone. The ground level inside the city is about 5 meters (16 ft) higher than the ground inside the city.
            <p>The palace in the center of the city is Jerrua’s final defense, with walls built in a similar manner. The area inside the palace is enormous, housing almost all the city’s official government buildings, barracks, and housing for a significant portion of the city’s officials. (Think of it almost like a military base inside a city.)
            <p>Over the years, the city’s walls have sustained significant damage and undergone repairs many times. Most recently, when Ascodel first became governor of the city, he began a reconstruction project for the walls. The project was completed after about 5 years, and currently the walls are in pristine condition.
            <p>For naval defense, a battleship is always on patrol just outside the harbor. Onshore, there are several mounted trebuchets and ballistas. Not far inland, a small natural cliff of 3-4 meters in height divides Harborside from Silverwalk and makes access to the rest of the city more difficult.
