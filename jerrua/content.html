<h4>Characteristics</h4>
        <p><b>Demographics.</b> Jerrua’s current urban population is about 120,000, with several surrounding rural towns and villages under its influence. The current population is nearly the smallest it’s been in several hundred years. Some 200 years ago, the population of Jerrua reached over 350,000, however after several bloody wars, a plague, and a mass exodus, the population dwindled to only about 90,000. Over the past 80 years, the city has regained some stability and begun recovering its population.
        <p><b>Geography.</b> Jerrua sits along the western coast of Mara's Bay, about halfway down, just where it starts to narrow. Jerrua rules a region of about 3,200 square miles, stretching about 80 miles vertically along the coast, and spreading about 40 miles out from it.
        
        <h4>Economy</h4>
        <p><b>Currency.</b> Jerrua uses gold, silver, and copper coin currency. All Jerruan coins are approximately 5g, meaning that copper and silver coins are about the size of a nickel, and gold coins slightly smaller than a penny. Jerruan coins have a commemorative image on the front, then minting information with no image on the back. Gold coins display a sword with a halo around it, representing Rihn the Sun Goddess, or one of six other images representing each of the other Maidens. Silver coins have the city of Jerrua or a profile of either Queen Athiel, or Ascodel (see History). Copper coins have either a merchant ship, a loom, or a honeycomb.
        <p><b>Wages.</b> The average income in Jerrua is 96-420 GP/year (or 18-80 SP/week). The median average is around 240 (46 SP/week). This range encompasses about 52% of the population, while 29% make less than this and 19% make more.
        
        <h4>Commerce & Industry</h4>
        <p>Jerrua’s close proximity to abundant natural resources coupled with its large harbor makes it a very prosperous city. Jerrua is a hub of sea trade, with countless imports and exports. Their primary exports come from two sources.
        <p><b>Whaling and aquaculture.</b> Whaling gives jobs to a large part of Jerrua, and has helped revolutionize Jerruan technology with the use of blubber oil. Whale meat, skin, bones, blubber, fat, wax, baleen, and ambergris are valuable resources, and used to make everything from tools to cosmetics to medicine. Fishing and fish hatcheries for fish and shellfish are also very common. Other resources are also cultivated from the ocean, such as spiny murex for dye, pen shells for sea-silk, oysters for pearls, and coral. 
        <p><b>Dyes and textiles.</b> Jerrua’s textile industry is massively supported by local leather, wool, cotton, and flax. Weaving, dying and dye-making, tanning and leatherworking, tailoring, and embroidery are common occupations in Jerrua. Woad, Madder, Weld, Indigo, Ochre, Kermes, and other dyeing materials are also either obtained locally or gathered. One of the major towns in Jerruan Province, Abeilvue, is also well known for its honeysilk, which is brought to Jerrua to be dyed and sold with the rest of the textiles.
        <p><b>Seabed Mining.</b> While not as common as aquaculture and textiles, underwater mining (for silver, gold, cobalt, and zinc), is also common. Lumber used to be a common natural resource, however, so many trees have been cut for construction and to clear fields. Although lumber is still locally available, most lumber is imported or comes from nearby towns in the Jerruan Province.
        <p><b>Agriculture.</b> Jerrua’s agriculture mainly takes place in Jerruan Province around the city. Much of it consists of sheep (for leather and wool), flax (for linen), and cotton. Besides these, wheat and cattle are especially common. Jerrua also boasts several distinguished grape vineyards. The Jerruan Province also has several apple and peach orchards, and vegetable farms of corn, string beans, and potatoes. The Abeilvue area is well-known for its many wildberries and watermelons.
        
        <h4>Culture</h4>
        <p><b>Social Classes.</b> The class system in Jerrua is less extreme than many places, but follows a familiar structure. While there is some class divide, people frequently interact with others of vastly different classes than themselves. There are five classes: Elite, High Class, Middle Class, Working Class, and Dregs.
        <p>The elite class is nobility, high clergy, and career-distinguished spellcasters. (There are 358 noble families in Jerrua.) The High Class is clergy, physicians, lawyers, scholars, spellcasters, engineers, and wealthy merchants. The Middle Class is the majority of the population: Artisans, tradesmen, business owners, staff personnel, high or elite retainers, and some agricultural workers such as farmers and fishermen. The Working Class is mostly farmers and fishermen, miners, manual laborers and common hirelings. The Dregs are the unemployed, bondsmen, and criminals.
        <p><b>Religion.</b> Religion in Jerrua is predominantly devoted to the Maidens Rihn and Maras, however much of the population focuses their worship on another Maiden. There are also several other obscure religions, creeds, and sects of worship. Notably, over the past century, a small cult of Ascodel has slowly developed in the city. Jerrua’s three most notable religions are Maidenism, Ascodelian, and Katalism.
          <p>Maidenism, also known as Septianity, is the worship of the Seven Maidens—creation deities responsible for recreating the world, and rescuing mankind from the end of the world almost 2,000 years ago. They live in Maerhiem (also known as The Maidens' Refuge), which is located just beyond Selin's Curtain. Rihn is the Maiden of the sun, patron goddess of Jerrua, and Queen of Maerhiem. Selin is the Maiden of the moon, and Rihn’s right hand in Maerhiem. Ventra is the Maiden of the sky. Dendra is the Maiden of the forest. Maras is the Maiden of the sea and the second patron goddess of Jerrua. Armis is the Maiden of the land. Therras is the Maiden of the fires of the depths. When referenced as a group, the Maidens are sometimes referred to as the Septimity.
          <p>Maidenism is the only formally recognized religion in Jerrua, however Jerrua is fairly tolerant of other religions. Rihn is the most worshiped of the Maidens, as the city’s patron goddess and Maras is second because of the city’s affiliations to the sea. Although different Maidens are often the focus of worship, they share a single religion. A cathedral devoted to one Maiden is always accompanied with secondary representation to the other six deities. Seven cathedrals to the Maidens are spread throughout Jerrua. The Great Cathedral emphasizes Rihn, and the other six cathedrals each emphasize a different Maiden. Other minor churches and shrines devoted to the Maidens are also spread throughout the city.
          <p>Ascodelian is a young religion worshipping Ascodel that sprung up shortly after he restored Jerrua. The church has usually remained relatively small, but over the past decade, its following has grown significantly. The Faith of Ascodel is a splinter group from the Seven Maidens that technically still worships them, however the focus of their worship is Ascodel. Ascodel's stance on the splinter sect has never been made known.
          <p>Katalism, otherwise known as the Order of the Red Sun, is an extremist zealot group and militant order who believes that it is their duty to save and govern the world when "the sun swells red again." They believe the Maidens' Church has lost its way and vocally condemn them often. Their sermons are fanatic and full of fire, brimstone, and doomsday prophecy. The law-keepers watch them closely, but have never had any reason to take action against them.
        <p><b>Fashion.</b> The general preference for both men and women is tight pants dyed dark, often with wide stripes, and accompanied by a brightly colored waist sash. Women also frequently wear light, loose skirts, often with layers or wide pleats. Shirts are worn loose and flowing for both men and women; women’s shirts also frequently incorporate lace, ruffles, and wide sleeves. Despite the vast local dye industry, white or cream colored shirts are most popular. Vests and doublets are popular among men. Women have partially adopted the mens’ vests as well as a variety of stylish corsages worn over their shirts. As an extra measure of warmth or formality, men wear sturdy jackets, women wear shawls, and both wear formal long coats.
        <p><b>Cuisine.</b> The Jerruan diet is rather diverse, however as would be expected, a significant portion of their cuisine consists of whale and a vast array of seafood. Common dish components also include beef, lamb, bread, dairy, and honey. These were often supplemented with a grape and honey wine and mead, sometimes fermented and fresh just as often. Fruits native to Jerrua include watermelon, apples, peaches, strawberries, raspberries, blueberries, and grapes. Native vegetables include cucumbers, string beans, sweet corn, tomatoes, and white potatoes.
        
        <h4>Government</h4>
        <p>The government of Jerrua resembles a oligarchy/representative democracy hybrid, with a senate consisting of top-appointed officials as well as elected representatives. However, most of the city’s power remains with Ascodel, and the Governor of Jerrua.
        <p><b>Senate.</b> The senate consists of three bodies: The Hall of the Governor, the Assembly of Nobles, and the Assembly of the People. The Hall of the Governor consists of the city’s 16 Lord Judges, as well as any other official the Governor thinks should be there. This usually includes the Lord General and Lords of Agriculture, Commerce, Science, and Magiturgy. The Assembly of the Nobles consists of 24 elected representatives of the elites. The Assembly of the People consists of 24 elected representatives of the ‘common’ classes. The senate is the legislative power in Jerrua.
        <p><b>Hall of Judges.</b> The Hall of Judges is the judicial and law-enforcement branch of Jerrua’s government, responsible for the punishment of criminals, and resolution of civil disputes. The Hall of Judges directly oversees the Law Keeper Legion (casually known as the Street Legion)—the daily, street-level law enforcement division.
        <p><b>Military.</b> Jerrua has a standing military force of 8,000, with the ability to conscript another 6,000 militia troops relatively quickly. If necessary, another 6,000 could be conscripted. In addition to these forces, a battalion of 800 radiance has remained in Jerrua with Ascodel. Part of the standing military are trained marines and cavalry. 1,000 men are trained and equipped as cavalry, and about 2,000 men are trained marines divided between 16 battleships.
        <p><b>Defense.</b> A massive stone wall wraps around the city and stretches over 100 meters into the ocean on either end. These stone walls stand 12 meters (39 ft) tall, 8 meters (26 ft) wide at the base, and 6 meters (20 ft) wide at the top. The top 2 meters of wall are less secure than the bottom 10, with a hollow interior that doubles as aqueducts. The wall also hosts several towers, spaced out every several hundred meters. The towers stand 18 meters (60 ft) tall, constructed of the same hard stone as the wall. The middle of the wall is made of cemented gravel, with only the inner and outer 2 meters being made of cut stone. The ground level inside the city is about 5 meters (16 ft) higher than the ground inside the city.
        <p>The palace in the center of the city is Jerrua’s final defense, with walls built in a similar manner. The area inside the palace is enormous, housing almost all the city’s official government buildings, barracks, and housing for a significant portion of the city’s officials. (Think of it almost like a military base inside a city.)
        <p>Over the years, the city’s walls have sustained significant damage and undergone repairs many times. Most recently, when Ascodel first became governor of the city, he began a reconstruction project for the walls. The project was completed after about 5 years, and currently the walls are in pristine condition.
        <p>For naval defense, a battleship is always on patrol just outside the harbor. Onshore, there are several mounted trebuchets and ballistas. Not far inland, a small natural cliff of 3-4 meters in height divides Harborside from Silverwalk and makes access to the rest of the city more difficult.
