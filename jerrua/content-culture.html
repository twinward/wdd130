            <h2>Culture</h2>
            <h3>Social Classes</h3>
            <p>The class system in Jerrua is less extreme than many places, but follows a familiar structure. While there is some class divide, people frequently interact with others of vastly different classes than themselves. There are five classes: Elite, High Class, Middle Class, Working Class, and Dregs.
            <p>The elite class is nobility, high clergy, and career-distinguished spellcasters. (There are 358 noble families in Jerrua.) The High Class is clergy, physicians, lawyers, scholars, spellcasters, engineers, and wealthy merchants. The Middle Class is the majority of the population: Artisans, tradesmen, business owners, staff personnel, high or elite retainers, and some agricultural workers such as farmers and fishermen. The Working Class is mostly farmers and fishermen, miners, manual laborers and common hirelings. The Dregs are the unemployed, bondsmen, and criminals.
            <h3>Fashion</h3>
            <p>The general preference for both men and women is tight pants dyed dark, often with wide stripes, and accompanied by a brightly colored waist sash. Women also frequently wear light, loose skirts, often with layers or wide pleats. Shirts are worn loose and flowing for both men and women; women’s shirts also frequently incorporate lace, ruffles, and wide sleeves. Despite the vast local dye industry, white or cream colored shirts are most popular. Vests and doublets are popular among men. Women have partially adopted the mens’ vests as well as a variety of stylish corsages worn over their shirts. As an extra measure of warmth or formality, men wear sturdy jackets, women wear shawls, and both wear formal long coats.
            <h3>Cuisine</h3>
            <p>The Jerruan diet is rather diverse, however as would be expected, a significant portion of their cuisine consists of whale and a vast array of seafood. Common dish components also include beef, lamb, bread, dairy, and honey. These were often supplemented with a grape and honey wine and mead, sometimes fermented and fresh just as often. Fruits native to Jerrua include watermelon, apples, peaches, strawberries, raspberries, blueberries, and grapes. Native vegetables include cucumbers, string beans, sweet corn, tomatoes, and white potatoes.
