            <h2>Economy</h2>
            <p><b>Currency.</b> Jerrua uses gold, silver, and copper coin currency. All Jerruan coins are approximately 5g, meaning that copper and silver coins are about the size of a nickel, and gold coins slightly smaller than a penny. Jerruan coins have a commemorative image on the front, then minting information with no image on the back. Gold coins display a sword with a halo around it, representing Rihn the Sun Goddess, or one of six other images representing each of the other Maidens. Silver coins have the city of Jerrua or a profile of either Queen Athiel, or Ascodel (see History). Copper coins have either a merchant ship, a loom, or a honeycomb.
            <p><b>Wages.</b> The average income in Jerrua is 96-420 GP/year (or 18-80 SP/week). The median average is around 240 (46 SP/week). This range encompasses about 52% of the population, while 29% make less than this and 19% make more.
            <h2>Commerce & Industry</h2>
            <p>Jerrua’s close proximity to abundant natural resources coupled with its large harbor makes it a very prosperous city. Jerrua is a hub of sea trade, with countless imports and exports. Their primary exports come from two sources.
            <p><b>Whaling and aquaculture.</b> Whaling gives jobs to a large part of Jerrua, and has helped revolutionize Jerruan technology with the use of blubber oil. Whale meat, skin, bones, blubber, fat, wax, baleen, and ambergris are valuable resources, and used to make everything from tools to cosmetics to medicine. Fishing and fish hatcheries for fish and shellfish are also very common. Other resources are also cultivated from the ocean, such as spiny murex for dye, pen shells for sea-silk, oysters for pearls, and coral. 
            <p><b>Dyes and textiles.</b> Jerrua’s textile industry is massively supported by local leather, wool, cotton, and flax. Weaving, dying and dye-making, tanning and leatherworking, tailoring, and embroidery are common occupations in Jerrua. Woad, Madder, Weld, Indigo, Ochre, Kermes, and other dyeing materials are also either obtained locally or gathered. One of the major towns in Jerruan Province, Abeilvue, is also well known for its honeysilk, which is brought to Jerrua to be dyed and sold with the rest of the textiles.
            <p><b>Seabed Mining.</b> While not as common as aquaculture and textiles, underwater mining (for silver, gold, cobalt, and zinc), is also common. Lumber used to be a common natural resource, however, so many trees have been cut for construction and to clear fields. Although lumber is still locally available, most lumber is imported or comes from nearby towns in the Jerruan Province.
            <p><b>Agriculture.</b> Jerrua’s agriculture mainly takes place in Jerruan Province around the city. Much of it consists of sheep (for leather and wool), flax (for linen), and cotton. Besides these, wheat and cattle are especially common. Jerrua also boasts several distinguished grape vineyards. The Jerruan Province also has several apple and peach orchards, and vegetable farms of corn, string beans, and potatoes. The Abeilvue area is well-known for its many wildberries and watermelons.
